GAS DETECTION SYSYTEM


AIM: The aim of a gas detection sensor is to detect the presence of a particular gas or gases in the surrounding environment.

Description of Block Diagram : In this block diagram we can see that Arduino board is acting like a microcontroller.
All the components like Virtual terminal , LCD display, actuators(Red and green LED's) , HC-05Bluetooth model and MQ-2 Gas sensor.Here logic toggle is connected to the MQ-2 gas sensor,basically its acting like a digital switch which is used to indicate whether the gas is leaked or not. 

Advantages : Gas detection systems are designed to continuously monitor the atmosphere for the presence of various gases

 1]Improved safety: Gas detection systems provide continuous monitoring of the atmosphere, alerting workers to the presence of harmful gases. This improves safety in industrial environments, where workers may be exposed to hazardous gases.
 2]Early detection of gas leaks: Gas detection systems can detect gas leaks early, which is critical in preventing accidents and explosions
 3]Environmental protection: Gas detection systems can help protect the environment by detecting and measuring harmful gases that may be released into the atmosphere


Future work : The future of gas detection systems is likely to involve advancements in technology that enable more accurate and efficient monitoring of the atmosphere.

 1]Artificial intelligence: Gas detection systems could utilize artificial intelligence to analyze data from multiple sensors and provide more accurate and timely warnings. AI could also help identify patterns in gas emissions and predict potential hazards.
 2]Internet of Things (IoT): IoT technology could allow gas detection systems to integrate with other systems in an industrial facility, such as ventilation or fire suppression systems. This could improve the overall safety and efficiency of the facility
